      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This game is based on Sudoku, it uses the same grid and numbering rules.
        There are 2 players on the same grid with the objective to be the first to make a set of 1 to 9 (using a legal move) in either a row, column or nonet.
        You simply need to insert the last number to complete a set, it does not have to consist entirely of your own numbers.
      </p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>A player can only use numbers 1 to 9.</li>
        <li>The same number cannot be placed in any row, column or nonet.</li>
        <li>A player may remove any number previously placed by them.</li>
        <li>A player may move a number placed by them to the same row, column or nonet provided it results in a legal move.</li>
        <li>A number that was last removed or moved cannot be placed on the same cell again.</li>
      </ol>
