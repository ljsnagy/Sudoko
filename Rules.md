## Overview

This game is inspired by Sudoku, it uses the same grid and numbering rules.
There are 2 players on the same grid with the objective to be the first to make a set of 1 to 9 (using a legal move) in either a row, column or nonet.
You simply need to insert the last number to complete a set, it does not have to consist entirely of your own numbers.

## Rules

1. A player can only use numbers 1 to 9.
2. The same number cannot be placed in any row, column or nonet.
3. A player may remove any number previously placed by them.
4. A player may move a number placed by them to the same row, column or nonet provided it results in a legal move.
5. A number that was last removed or moved cannot be placed on the same cell again.
